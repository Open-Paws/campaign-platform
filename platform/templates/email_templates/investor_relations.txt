Dear {{ ir_contact_name }},

I am writing to request information regarding material risks related to {{ company_name }}'s {{ business_segment }} operations that I believe warrant disclosure to investors.

BACKGROUND:
Recent {{ source_type }} ({{ source_reference }}, {{ source_date }}) has documented the following concerning {{ company_name }}'s operations:

{% for item in risk_items %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

MATERIALITY CONCERNS:
These findings raise questions about material risks in several categories:

Regulatory Risk: {{ regulatory_risk_description }}
The current regulatory environment is trending toward stricter enforcement in this area. {{ regulatory_trend_detail }}.

Reputational Risk: {{ reputational_risk_description }}
Public awareness of these practices is growing, as evidenced by {{ public_awareness_evidence }}.

Litigation Risk: {{ litigation_risk_description }}
Similar operations have faced legal action including {{ comparable_litigation }}.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:
1. Has {{ company_name }}'s board assessed the material risks described above? If so, what was the conclusion?
2. What is {{ company_name }}'s current policy regarding {{ policy_area }}?
3. Has {{ company_name }} received any regulatory notices, warning letters, or citations related to {{ violation_area }} in the past 36 months?
4. What capital expenditures or operational changes has {{ company_name }} budgeted for compliance with {{ upcoming_regulation }}?
5. How does {{ company_name }} plan to address the competitive disadvantage of maintaining current practices while peers transition to {{ industry_trend }}?

I am requesting a written response within 30 business days. Should these material risks not be adequately addressed in {{ company_name }}'s upcoming {{ next_filing }} filing, I intend to raise these concerns through {{ escalation_channel }}.

Respectfully,
