STANDING:

SUMMARY OF MY COMMENT:
I {{ support_or_oppose }} the proposed rule {{ with_modifications }}. Specifically, I urge the agency to:

{% for recommendation in recommendations %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ recommendation }}
{% endfor %}

SUBSTANTIVE BASIS:

1. Scientific Evidence
{{ scientific_evidence }}

The agency's own data shows {{ agency_data_point }}. Peer-reviewed research published in {{ journal_name }} ({{ citation }}) further demonstrates {{ research_finding }}.

2. Legal Authority
The agency has clear authority under {{ statutory_authority }} to {{ action_description }}. In {{ relevant_case }}, the court held that {{ legal_precedent }}.

The agency's stated goal of {{ agency_goal }} is inconsistent with the current proposal because {{ inconsistency_explanation }}.

3. Economic Analysis
The agency's cost-benefit analysis {{ cba_critique }}. Specifically:

- The proposed rule {{ underestimates_or_overestimates }} the cost of {{ cost_factor }} by failing to account for {{ missing_factor }}
- Externalities not included in the analysis include: {{ externalities }}
- The economic benefits of the stronger standard I propose include: {{ benefits }}

{% if industry_comparison %}
4. Industry Precedent
{{ industry_comparison }}. This demonstrates that the standard I am requesting is technically feasible and economically viable.
{% endif %}

SPECIFIC REGULATORY TEXT RECOMMENDATIONS:
{% for text_change in text_changes %}
- Section {{ text_change.section }}: Change "{{ text_change.current }}" to "{{ text_change.proposed }}" because {{ text_change.rationale }}
{% endfor %}

CONCLUSION:
The agency has both the authority and the obligation to act. The evidence supports a {{ stronger_or_weaker }} standard than currently proposed. I urge you to {{ final_ask }}.

I request that this comment be included in the public docket and considered in the final rulemaking.
